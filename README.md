# Run the testcases automatically for c++ assignments

Feel tired of typing "pa1 < testcase/input01.txt > myOutput01.txt" and comparing your output with the sample output again and again? Use this simple python program to do them automatically!

Basically for hkust students taking COMP2011

<hr>

## How to get the "!CppTester.py"

 - You can download the zip from < Code > in github or click [this link](https://github.com/hwtam/run-the-testcases-automatically-for-cpp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
 - Extract "!CppTester.py" from the zip

### How to use?

- Put the '!CppTester.py' into the same folder of your main cpp file
- Make sure ONLY the materials of this assignment are in the folder
- Just don't put other .cpp files in that folder

### Run the "!CppTester.py"!

In the terminal, it shows : 
- the name(s) of your cpp file(s) {remove unwanted cpp files}
- the results of each testcases
- "DONE", telling you that the program ends

## Why it is not working?? - Some tips/rules

- Make sure python is installed in your computer (especially when you use the portable VScode provided by cse)
- Make sure python and c++ is in your PATH
- Don't use python IDLE to run the !CppTester.py, use IDE(VScode for example) instead
- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/hwtam/run-the-testcases-automatically-for-cpp-assignments/issues/new/choose)

You will see something like : "error", "invalid". It means that your program is WRONG.

You can try to compile your program by yourself to see what is the problem.

### In case you are interested in the program, you can move on to the [wiki](https://github.com/hwtam/run-the-testcases-automatically-for-cpp-assignments/wiki).

### The program is unable to improve your programming skill and help you get a better grade.
