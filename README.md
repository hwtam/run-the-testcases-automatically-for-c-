<h1>Run the testcases automatically for c++ assignments</h1>

<p>Feel tired of typing "pa1 < testcase/input01.txt > myOutput01.txt" and comparing your output with the sample output again and again? Use this simple python program to do them automatically!</p>

<p>Basically for hkust students taking comp c++ courses (I don't know how other school are doing XD)</p>

<p>(However, you may watch [How if you are not hkust student but still facing similiar problem when your professor tells you to compare your output with given sample input and output?](https://github.com/hwtam/run-the-testcases-automatically-for-cpp/blob/main/README.md#how-if-you-are-not-hkust-student-but-still-facing-similiar-problem-when-your-professor-tells-you-to-compare-your-output-with-given-sample-input-and-output) before leaving.)</p>

<h2>How to get the "!CppTester.py"</h2>

 - You can download the zip from < Code > in github or click [this link](https://github.com/hwtam/run-the-testcases-automatically-for-cpp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
 - Extract "!CppTester.py" from the zip

<h3>How to use?</h3>

- Put the '!CppTester.py' into the same folder of your main cpp file
- Make sure ONLY the materials of this assignment are in the folder
- Just don't put other .cpp files in that folder

<h3>Run the "!CppTester.py"!</h3>

In the terminal, it shows : 
- the name(s) of your cpp file(s) {remove unwanted cpp files}
- the results of each testcases
- "DONE", telling you that the program ends

<h2>Why it is not working?? - Some tips/rules</h2>

- Make sure python is installed in your computer
- Don't use python IDLE to run the !CppTester.py, use IDE(VScode for example) instead
- [Open a new issue](https://github.com/hwtam/run-the-testcases-automatically-for-cpp-assignments/issues/new/choose)

<p>You may see something like : "error", "invalid". It means that your program is WRONG.</p>

<p>You can try to compile your program by yourself to see what is the problem.</p>

## How if you are not HKUST student but still facing similiar problem when your professor tells you to compare your output with given sample input and output?

<p>You can still use this simple pyhton program!!</p>

<p>What you need to do is just rename your testcases in the format below:</p>

- sample input cases -> input*.txt (* can be any string you like)
- sample output cases -> output*.txt (* should be equal to the * of the corresponding sample input case)
